## Towards 1.0

- The goal of 1.0 is to be feature compatible with everything I currently have in bash scripts.

- [ ] build, test, and run, migrate wrappers capable of detecting type of project.
- [ ] port-forward dev DB and optionally open pgsql shell.
- [ ] provide a way to open pgsql shell for prod DBs.
- [ ] provide a way to open pgsql shell for local DBs.

## Disclaimer

This project is strongly opinionated and works when conventions for repositories are setup in a particular way. Sane options are provided in some cases to override this default functionality.
